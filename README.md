# PhotoPrism React Native client â›³

This an Expo cross-platform native client for PhotoPrism to sync your library.

> Because of the undocumented Photoprism's API, I decided to left Photoprism and go with Immich, which provided a free IOS client. 

## Get started

```bash
npm install &&  npx expo start
```
